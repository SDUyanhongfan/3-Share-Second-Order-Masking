The HDL codes of GIFT and RECTANGLE ciphers  belong entirely to Yanhong Fan, Chaoran Wang, Lixuan Wu, Meiqin Wang. Other HDL codes (i.e.， Keccak, Midori, PRESENT, PRINCE, SKINNY ) are modified based on https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/NullFresh2, simply replacing the previous mask circuit with the mask circuit found in this paper “ A Fast Search Method for 3-Share Second-Order Masking Schemes for Lightweight S-Boxes”.
